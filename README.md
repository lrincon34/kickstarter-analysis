**Goal Amount**

After analyzing <u>successful</u> U.S. Kickstarters in the ***plays*** subcategory, we have determined that having a goal amount of $5,000 or less, will help your campaing be successful.

**Deadline**

The deadline specified for your campaign will also determnine the success of your kickstarter. The successful kickstarters had an average deadline of 29 days, or about a month. Below you will find the number of successful kickstarters that had an average deadline of ***29 days or less***. 

|Successful Kickstarters < 29 days| Total Successful Kickstarters|
|:---:|:---:|
|195|412|
As you can see, 47% of successful kickstarters, had an average deadline of 29 days, therefore staying around this number should help. 

###Conclusion

Well Louise, based on the analysis I have performed, I would recommend that you plan your campaign with a goal amount of <u>no more than $5,000</u>. Also try and start your kickstarter during <u>**May- June**</u> and anticipate having a <U>short deadline</u>, keeping it around a month's range.
